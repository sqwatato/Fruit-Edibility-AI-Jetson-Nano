Jetson AI Detect Project

Welcome!

This project is a proof of concept for a system desnined to send emails when a person is detected! 
Google recently made it so 3rd party apps no longer can access gmail through insecure methods such as no ssl encryption. This complicates things greatly and most services are the same way. Thus the email sending function may not work as expected.

Thanks for looking at this project! I hope it exceeds your expecations

# Prerequisites

1. Jetson nano
2. python installed
3. USB webcam
4. HDMI cable, keyboard, mouse (optional)


# Limitations

Note that this program will need access to your email account of choice, you must get an app password and or allow less secure apps.

# Additional Notes

This project is open source! Please feel free to take as you wish and edit it as needed. hook up other functions or compleatly rewrite it from the ground up! The choice is yours!
